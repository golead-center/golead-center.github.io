                <p>Associate Professor Quitoriano is the founding director of goLEAD and has been involved in leadership activities since 1993. He has been involved in starting several organizations and has learned greatly from those experiences. His research background is in semiconductor growth and devices.</p>
                <p>In October 2016, he was asked to start a leadership initiative by Dean Nicell and began by surveying the leadership learning opportunities around campus. After attending many of the existing workshops he found that there was a missing niche, applied leadership skill development, and thus developed the MOVE program which gives students a project-based learning experience.</p>
                <p>Prof. Quitoriano loves interacting with members of the goLEAD organization as a teacher and mentor at all levels. He is thankful that students show enthusiasm in the program in general and is most grateful to the students and volunteers who have helped to establish and maintain the offerings of goLEAD.</p>

                <p>Associate Professor, Mining and Materials Engineering. I worked as a process engineer for an engineering consulting company, and was the first chemical engineer at a green-tech start-up in Silicon Valley before working in academia. Rowing and coaching in university were some of the extra-curricular activities that complimented my studies.</p>
                <p>My engineering training continues to be critical to my career, however, the skills I learned outside of the classroom were also important for achieving career and life goals. Therefore I wish to contribute towards extracurricular programs such as MOVE goLEAD.</p>
                <p>Hearing the diverse range of ideas and opinions from students is my favourite aspect of being part of this program.</p>
