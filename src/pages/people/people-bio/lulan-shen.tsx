          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a PhD student in Electrical Engineering, specialized in deep learning. My research work focuses on compressed neural networks, domain adaptation, computer vision, and computer hardware. I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Computing at University of Oxford and had been working for Bosch Automotive for about 3 years. I have participated in the goLEAD program from 2020 Move to 2021 Launch.

          <h2>Why did you get involved with goLEAD?</h2>
          <p>
            Even small ideas may contribute to making a difference in the future. School teaches you a lot of valuable knowledge, except telling you how to be an entrepreneur. I have initiated some ideas with my expertise but never have a hand-on experience to convert my ideas into real products. I would like to learn through goLEAD to validate our defined problem, determine a sustainable solution, as well as improving my leadership skills.

          <p>
            I enjoyed the time working with my teammates and fighting for the same goal. I met lots of amazing people who I might share my career with.
